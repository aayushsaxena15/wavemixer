#About:

-> Wave Mixer is a tool designed to play with wave file of given format (mono, 16KHz, 16-bit PCM).
-> With this tool you can change the amplitude,scale the time,shift the time of the wave.You can also revese the wave.
-> You can mix/modulate upto three waves and alter the properties of the newly generated wave.
-> You can also record any voice as a wave of format(mono, 16KHz, 16-bit PCM) and alter its  properties too.
-> Try using it you will have fun.

#To run:

-> python main.py


#Required library:

-> wave
-> pyaudio
-> struct
-> PyQt4
-> gui

#Assumption:

-> Format of wave file : (mono, 16KHz, 16-bit PCM)
-> When two wave of different length are mixed/modulated , the small wave is appended to itself utill its size become equal to the size of the large wave, after this mixing/modulation is carried out and new wave of size equal two larger wave is generated.
